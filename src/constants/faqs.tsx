      I don't know how great the accomplishment was to others, but my most formative
      accomplishment was the Farm Manager I built at Crop One, a now-defunct
      hydroponics lettuce company. It was a system used by the Production and
      Science teams to improve the efficiency, traceability, and data integrity of
      operations around the farm. It employed intuitive UIs and data visualization
      that mimicked real-life infrastructure.

          I'd say <strong>my greatest strength is curiosity</strong>. The older and more
          experienced I become, the more I lean into it, allowing curiosity to override
          ego, sureness, and even boredom. Everyone has something to teach you. Every
          subject has unknowns. From every meeting, however boring, can insight be
          gleaned! But let's keep them to a minimum anyway, shall we?

        <Typography pb={2}>
          <strong>My greatest weakness is perfectionism</strong>. I don't want to put
          my name on something unless it's unimpeachable. This is a holdover from
          earlier in my career, when I had an egoâ€”now the ego is gone, but the shame
          lives on ðŸ«  But that perfectionism also means I deliver tested, well-
          documented, readable, and sometimes even performant code!
