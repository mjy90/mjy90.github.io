In the backend, a daily job would check for new flat files, provided in various formats by
insurance carriers, extract and normalize that data, and store it in a SQL Server database.
The frontend was designed to be simple and easy-to-use to meet our clientele where they are,
since they weren't the most tech-savvy. Code-wise, the interface was a standalone modal
window that could be dropped into any page with a single line of code. This was important
because I was working from rather... shall we say "freeform" requirements, and I didn't
want to shoot Future Mike in the foot.
