 I threw together a
      website, designed a snazzy logo, and built up a small inventory of products.
      I sold (and still sell!) mostly home goods, and I did a couple of custom commissions for friends
      and family. Christmas gifts were a big hit that year, too!
      I also started a YouTube channel, but I pivoted away from that after uploading just one video.
      There are a couple more half-done videos sitting on a hard drive along with dozens of hours of
      footage from other projects. I'll get back to editing those one of these days...
      Less technically impressive than the rest, but The Mikerspace represents a scary thing that I took a whack
      at. I was fed up with a dead-end software job with toxic management, so I decided burning
      through my savings to start a woodworking business was a worthwhile endeavor.
